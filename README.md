# Application Deployment Documentation

**Overview**

This repository contains a simple application designed to demonstrate containerization, CI/CD automation, and Kubernetes deployment. The application includes:
1. A Spring Boot REST API with a single endpoint (e.g., GET /books) connected to a NoSql DB.
2. Dockerized application setup.
3. CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing the Docker image to a docker hub container registry.
4. Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application on Minikube.


**Steps to Build and Run the Application Locally Using Docker**

1. Clone the Repository

`git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>`

2. Build the Docker Image

`docker build -t springboot-app .`

3. Run the Docker Container

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 springboot-app
`
4. Access the Application

The service will be accessible at: localhost:8080/books

**Steps to Deploy the Application on Minikube**

1. Start Minikube

Start Minikube with sufficient resources:

`minikube start --cpus=2 --memory=2048
`

2. Enable Docker in Minikube

Use Minikubeâ€™s Docker environment to build images directly:

`eval $(minikube docker-env)
`

3. Check minikube status

3. Create a namespace to deploy the service

`kubectl create ns prod`

3. Apply Kubernetes Manifests 

secret.yaml (To store the mongodb uri connection )

`kubectl apply -f kubernetes/secret.yaml -n prod
`

deployment.yaml (for deploying the application)

`kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml -n prod
`

service.yaml (for exposing the application)

`kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml -n prod
`

5. Verify the Deployments

`kubectl get pods -n prod,
kubectl get services -n prod, kubectl get secret -n prod, kubectl get deploy -n prod`

6. Access the Application

port forward the service

`kubectl port-forward service/book-service 30007:8080 -n prod
`
http://localhost/books

**CI/CD Pipeline Explanation**

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml. It automates the following steps:

* Build the Docker Image:
The workflow uses the docker build command to create an image.

* Push the Image to a Registry:
The workflow pushes the image to Docker Hub.
Authentication credentials are securely stored as GitHub Secrets (DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD).

* Triggers:
The pipeline runs on every push or pull_request to the main branch.

**Assumptions and Decisions**

A simple REST API Endpoint (GET /books) was implemented using Spring Boot for ease of demonstration.

In a production environment, steps like automated testing, linting, and deployment would be included in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality and continuous delivery of the application.

**Challenges Faced**

Docker Build Caching: Optimizing the Dockerfile to cache dependencies for faster rebuilds.

CI/CD Secrets Management: Safeguarding registry credentials using GitHub Secrets.

**Future Enhancements**

GitOps tools such as ArgoCD or Flux could be leveraged to manage the continuous delivery of Kubernetes resources. 
These tools would monitor Git repositories for changes to configuration files (like Kubernetes manifests) and automatically deploy updates to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring the application is always in sync with the desired state defined in version control.
